Weight is always entered by user

Volume in syringe could probably just always be entered by user

Dose in syringe would be
Infusion dose x infusion rate x volume in syringe

Infusion rate would be
(Dose in syringe / volume of syringe) x Infusion dose

Infusion dose would be
(Dose in syringe / volume of syringe) / weight * infusion rate

This doesn’t include the unit changes of grams to micrograms and ml/hr to mcg/min
Can do more on that, or layer in after we’ve got the above sorted?
